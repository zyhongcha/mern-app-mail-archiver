This mail archiver is a MERN stack application and requires an internet connection and Docker to be installed on your computer for initializing.

Navigate to the directory solution and run the app by using docker compose like so: docker-compose-up --build, app should be then accessible on http://localhost:3000/

You can see some of my prepared mails when selecting the dates between 2020/11/24 and 2021/03/31.

If you wish to start client or server seperately, navigate to the respective directory and type in command line npm start.
